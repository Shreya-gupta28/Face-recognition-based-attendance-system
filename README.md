# Face-recognition-based-attendance-system
This system is used to decrease mistakes that frequently occur with the conventional attendance-taking method. The main objective is to automate and create an algorithm that will be beneficial to the institution or other organization. The modern and precise way of recording attendance in offices will easily replace the previous methods. Hence, this approach is workable, trustworthy, and sufficiently safe. The system may be installed in the office without the use of specialized hardware. A camera and computer may be used to create it. The creation of this system is a creative approach that offers an effective and dependable technique for tracking attendance.
Face recognition-based attendance system

A Python GUI integrated attendance system using face recognition to take attendance.

In this Python project, I have made an attendance system that takes attendance by using the face recognition technique. I have also integrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made in Python using Tkinter.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1. tkinter for the whole GUI
2. OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
3. CSV, Numpy, Pandas, date-time, etc. for other purposes.

FEATURES:
1) Easy to use with interactive GUI support.
2) Password protection for new person registration.
3) Creates/Updates CSV file for details of students on registration.
4) Create a new CSV file every day for attendance and mark attendance with the proper date and time.
5) Displays live attendance updates for the day on the main screen in tabular format with ID, name, date, and time.
